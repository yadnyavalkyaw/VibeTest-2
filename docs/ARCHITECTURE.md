# VibeTest — Architecture & Data Flow

Status: **frozen for Phase 1** (Week 3 checkpoint artifact for the paper-writer).
Changes require agreement of all three team members. See `PROJECTS.md` for the
decision rationale and `AGENTS.md` for coding conventions.

## Research direction extension (2026-10)

The original website-scan pipeline below remains available and keeps its `Artifact`
and `Finding` contracts. The research foundation is a separate offline workflow under
`vibetest/research/`: imported observations → versioned behavior profile → deterministic
profile comparison → JSON behavior graph and graph diff → optional matching against a
separately imported verification profile. The research workflow makes zero target
requests and handles no credentials. Automated authenticated runtime collection is
blocked by the repository scope policy; see `docs/RESEARCH_DIRECTION.md`.

```text
Imported observation JSON (V0) → BehaviorProfile baseline ─┐
                                                           ├→ comparison + graph diff
Imported observation JSON (V1) → BehaviorProfile ─────────┘          │
Separate imported verification observations ─────────────────────────┤
                                                                     ▼
                                        regression candidates + supplied-data status
```

This is an initial deterministic data-processing foundation, not a complete static,
dynamic, or authorization-intent analysis system. The MiniShop files are synthetic
fixtures, not a running application or measured research result.

## 1. Design summary

Plugin-based **deterministic pipeline** + **local-LLM explanation layer** (hybrid).
The LLM never touches the target and never participates in detection — it only turns
confirmed findings into plain-English explanations for non-expert users.
URL/endpoint **discovery is delegated to Katana** (ProjectDiscovery, MIT, external
binary); fetching, JS-bundle extraction, and fingerprinting stay in-house.

```
URL input
  → consent/allowlist gate            (core/consent.py — every request passes through)
  → discovery: Katana (MIT, external) (acquisition/katana.py — URL/endpoint enumeration)
  → fetch + extract (httpx+Playwright)(acquisition/crawler.py, js_bundle.py)
  → Artifact (CONTRACT 1)             (schemas/artifacts.py)
  → detector plugins [1..N]           (detectors/ — one vulnerability class per file)
  → Findings (CONTRACT 2)             (schemas/findings.py)
  → aggregate: dedup + severity       (analysis/)
  → explanation: local Ollama | template fallback   (reporting/explain.py)
  → HTML report / localhost dashboard (reporting/, web/)
```

## 3. The two contracts (Week 2 freeze)

**Artifact** — produced by acquisition, the *only* input detectors may see:
`scan_id, target_url, fetched_at, pages[] (url, status_code, headers, html),
js_bundles[] (url, content, source_map_url?), endpoints[] (url, method, params),
tech (framework, hosting, backend_services[]), tls, cookies[], errors[]`

**Finding** — emitted by every detector:
`finding_id, detector_id, category, cwe_id, owasp_2025, severity, confidence,
title, evidence[] (url, snippet, detail), remediation_hint, explanation (nullable —
filled later by the explanation layer)`

## 4. Detector interface

```python
class BaseDetector(ABC):
    id: ClassVar[str]
    name: ClassVar[str]
    layer: ClassVar[int] = 1              # 1 = passive baseline · 2 = vibe-specific
    needs_probes: ClassVar[bool] = False  # Layer-2 detectors declare extra requests

    @abstractmethod
    def run(self, artifact: Artifact, ctx: ScanContext) -> list[Finding]: ...
```

Rules: detectors never fetch on their own — they reason over the Artifact. Layer-2
detectors that need extra requests (e.g. the Supabase `/rest/v1/` probe) set
`needs_probes = True` and use `ctx.http`, which the orchestrator only provides when
probes are enabled — and even then, every request goes through the consent gate.

## 5. Data flow (one scan, end to end)

1. `vibetest scan <url>` → **consent gate**: not on allowlist → hard refuse + log.
2. **Acquisition** (A): consent-gated Katana crawl → discovered URLs → httpx fetch →
   SPA? → Playwright render → bundles, endpoints, fingerprint → `Artifact` → SQLite.
3. **Detection** (B): registry fans out enabled detectors over the Artifact → `Finding[]`.
4. **Analysis** (B): dedup by `(detector_id, evidence-hash)` → severity ordering.
5. **Explanation** (B): per finding — cache hit? else Ollama (temp 0, JSON schema),
   else template → fill `explanation`.
6. **Report** (B): Jinja2 → self-contained HTML (+PDF in W9); dashboard reads SQLite —
   scan once, re-render without re-scanning.

## 6. Build order (Weeks 1–5, builders in parallel)

| Week | Builder A (acquisition & core) | Builder B (detection & reporting) |
|---|---|---|
| 1–2 | schemas co-authored & frozen; CLI skeleton | detector framework + detectors vs mock artifacts |
| 3 | httpx fetcher + Katana discovery wrapper | headers + exposed_files detectors |
| 4 | Playwright SPA rendering + js_bundle | secrets-in-bundle + OSV deps detectors |
| 5 | tech fingerprinter | **supabase_rls detector (flagship)** → Friday end-to-end run |

## 7. Deferred / open decisions (recorded so nobody re-litigates them)

- **Katana dependency mode** — DECIDED: soft dependency (optional binary, graceful
  fallback to plain httpx crawl). Full rationale in PROJECTS.md §11; not an open item.
- **Dashboard** — DECIDED: FastAPI + Jinja2, localhost-only; scan launcher + results viewer, gated by the same consent allowlist (single-flight).
- **PDF export** — implemented via Playwright `page.pdf()` (reuses the `[crawl]` extra; WeasyPrint dropped — it needs a separate GTK runtime on Windows).
- **Playwright** — implemented: optional `[crawl]` extra (`pip install -e ".[crawl]"` + `playwright install chromium`); renders SPA shells only; every browser request is consent-gated; graceful raw-HTML fallback.
- **Ownership-verification flow** (meta-tag/file upload): stretch goal, post-MVP.
